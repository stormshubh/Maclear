I fled Him, down the nights and down the days; 
 I fled Him, down the arches of the years;
 I fled Him, down the labyrinthine ways 
 Of my own mind; and in the mist of tears 
 I hid from Him, and under running laughter.
 Up vistaed hopes I sped;
And shot, precipitated;
Adown Titanic glooms of chasmed fears;
From those strong Feet that followed, followed after.
But with unhurrying chase;
And unperturbed pace;
Deliberate speed, majestic instancy;
They beat—and a Voice beat
More instant than the Feet—
'All things betray thee, who betrayest Me.'
